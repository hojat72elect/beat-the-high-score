At first I wanted to add this game to <a href="https://github.com/hojat72elect/libgdx_extensions_hojat">this</a>
repository but it's a huge game (and is fully written in Kotlin so worth a special attention) so I decided to keep it
in a separate repository.

The main game is published <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.dwursteisen.beat">Google Play Store</a> but in here I'm trying to play with and learn the code base as deeply as I can and make up my own tools for faster game development in LibGDX and Kotlin.
