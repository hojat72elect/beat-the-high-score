At first I wanted to add this game to <a href="https://github.com/hojat72elect/libgdx_extensions_hojat">my main repo for
extending LibGDX</a> but it's a very big game (and completely written
in Kotlin, so worth additional attention) so I decided to put it in a separate repo of its own.

The main game is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.dwursteisen.beat">Google
Play Store</a> and in here I'm trying to read and understand it as deeply as I can.
